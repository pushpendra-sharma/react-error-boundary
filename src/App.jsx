        <b>
          This is an example of error boundaries in React 18.
          <br />
          <br />
          Click on the numbers to increase the counters.
          <br />
          The counter is programmed to throw when it reaches 5. This simulates a
          JavaScript error in a component.
        </b>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <p>
          These two counters are inside the same error boundary. If one crashes,
          the error boundary will replace both of them.
        </p>
        <BuggyCounter />
        <BuggyCounter />
      </ErrorBoundary>
      <hr />
      <p>
        These two counters are each inside of their own error boundary. So if
        one crashes, the other is not affected.
      </p>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <BuggyCounter />
      </ErrorBoundary>
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <BuggyCounter />

    </div>
